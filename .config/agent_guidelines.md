# Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines.

## Committing code

- Follow the Conventional Commit specification.
- When making a commit using the command line, use single quotes for the commit
  message to avoid unintended variable and command substitution.
- Do not use backticks in the commit title, but do use them in the body when
  needed.
